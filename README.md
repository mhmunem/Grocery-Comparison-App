# Grocery Comparison App

## How to Run

This project uses docker compose for development, testing, and release.

The run the client, server, or pgadmin separately simple run `sudo docker compose -f <respective_compose_file> up`.
One can also run multiple docker compose files at the same time.
E.g. `sudo docker compose -f ./docker-compose-db.yml -f ./docker-compose-server.yml up` to run the server with database.
However, to run the entire stack (client, server, and pgadmin) in parallel run `sudo docker compose up`.
To automatically restart the containers in case of any changes use `--watch`. E.g. `sudo docker compose up --watch`.

On Windows `sudo` is not required.

## Running Tests

**Server**

From the root directory run: `sudo docker compose -f server/docker-compose-server-test.yml -f server/docker-compose-server-test-override.yml up --watch --build`.
The tests will automatically rerun when any files in `server/` change.

**Client**

ETA: soon

**End-to-end Tests**

From the root directory run: `sudo docker compose -f client/docker-compose-e2e.yml -f client/compose-override-e2e.yml up --build --watch`.
The tests will automatically rerun when any files in `server/` or `client/` change.

## Prerequisites

### Node.js and npm Installation

1. Download:
   - Download the latest **LTS version** of Node.js from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/). This installation includes npm.
   - Alternatively, follow detailed instructions for your OS from [this guide](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/).

2. Verify Installation:
   Run the following commands to confirm installation:

#### Troubleshooting

##### If node or npm Is Not Recognized

1. **Check PATH Variable**:
   Ensure that node and npm are added to your system's PATH.
   - Windows:
     - Open System Properties > Environment Variables.
     - Locate the Path variable in System Variables and ensure it includes the directory where Node.js was installed (C:\Program Files\nodejs\).
2. **Other issue check here** (https://medium.com/@ruben.alapont/troubleshooting-common-npm-issues-tips-and-solutions-c6d0cd094d56)

# PostgreSQL Setup and Quick Reference Guide

This README provides detailed instructions for installing PostgreSQL, setting up roles and databases, and basic commands to get started.

## 1. Install PostgreSQL

### Windows

1. Download PostgreSQL from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. During installation, set up a PostgreSQL superuser (default is postgres) with a password.

## 2. Accessing PostgreSQL

After installation, access PostgreSQL using the psql CLI from installation folder
- enter  Server [localhost]:
            Database [postgres]:
            Port [5432]:
            Username [postgres]:
            Password for user postgres:

## 3. PostgreSQL Basics

### View Connection Information

```
\conninfo
```

### Quit the PostgreSQL Command Line

```
\q
```

## 4. Creating Roles and Setting Permissions

### Create a Role

```
CREATE ROLE admin WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'admin';
```

### Grant Permissions to the Role

- Allow the role to create databases:
  ```
  ALTER ROLE admin CREATEDB;
  ```
- View the list of roles:
  ```
  \du
  ```
  Example Output:
  ```
                               List of roles
   Role name |                         Attributes
  --+
   admin     | Create DB
   postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS
  ```


## 5. Creating and Connecting to a Database

### Create a Database

```
CREATE DATABASE api;
```

### Connect to the Database

```
\c api
```
- This switches to the api database and uses the admin user (if logged in as admin).

Example Output:

```
You are now connected to database "api" as user "admin".
```

## 6. Working with Tables

### List Tables in the Current Schema

```sql
\dt
```

## 7. Example Workflow

1. Access PostgreSQL as a superuser:
   ```
   psql -U postgres
   ```
2. Create a new role with login credentials:
   ```
   CREATE ROLE admin WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'admin';
   ```
3. Grant the `CREATEDB` privilege to the `admin` role:
   ```
   ALTER ROLE admin CREATEDB;
   ```
4. Create a new database named `api`:
   ``
   CREATE DATABASE api;
   ```
5. Switch to the `api` database:
   ```
   \c api
   ```
6. Verify the connection:
   ```
   \conninfo
   ```
7. View tables in the current schema (if any):
   ```
   \dt
   ```

## 8. Additional Commands
### List All Schemas
```
\dn
```

### View Database Information
```
\l
```

### Delete a Role
```
DROP ROLE admin;
```

## 9. Common Troubleshooting
- Permission Denied: Check the role's permissions using `\du`.

# Crawlee Setup Guide

### Overview

We are using Crawlee, a robust web scraping and automation library, to build scalable crawlers with support for multiple frameworks like Playwright, Puppeteer, and Cheerio.
Future iterations may include cloud deployment for enhanced scalability and storage.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (node -v)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn (npm -v)
- A folder for the project is already created.


### Installation

1. Clone the repo

    ```
    git clone -b <branch_name> <repo_url>

    cd webscraping
    ```

2. Install Dependencies (if not in package.json file else just use 'npm install')
   Install Crawlee with support for Playwright, Puppeteer, and Cheerio:

   ```
   npm install crawlee playwright puppeteer cheerio
   ```

---

### Configure Crawlers

#### PlaywrightCrawler
Playwright is used for advanced interactions with modern web pages. Example setup:

```
const { PlaywrightCrawler } = require('crawlee');

const playwrightCrawler = new PlaywrightCrawler({
    headless: true, // Set to false for visible browser
    async requestHandler({ page, request }) {
        console.log(`Scraping ${request.url}`);
        const content = await page.content();
        console.log(content);
    },
});

await playwrightCrawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev']);
```

#### PuppeteerCrawler
Puppeteer is another headless browser framework, ideal for scraping JavaScript-heavy websites.

```
const { PuppeteerCrawler } = require('crawlee');

const puppeteerCrawler = new PuppeteerCrawler({
    headless: true, // Set to false for debugging
    async requestHandler({ page, request }) {
        console.log(`Scraping ${request.url}`);
        const content = await page.content();
        console.log(content);
    },
});

await puppeteerCrawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev']);
```

#### CheerioCrawler
Cheerio is a lightweight and fast solution for scraping static HTML pages.

```
const { CheerioCrawler } = require('crawlee');

const cheerioCrawler = new CheerioCrawler({
    async requestHandler({ $ }) {
        console.log('Scraping static content');
        const title = $('title').text();
        console.log(`Page title: ${title}`);
    },
});

await cheerioCrawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev']);
```

### Running the Crawler

Run the following command to execute your script:

```
node src/main.js
```

Check the ```package.json``` scripts to start the server if none use the above scripts
